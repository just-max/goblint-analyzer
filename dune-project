(lang dune 2.9)
; need 2.9 for dune-site to work with opam install: https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/4212, https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/4645, https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/4774
(using dune_site 0.1)
(name goblint)
; build failed with: Files src/.maingoblint.eobjs/native/mutex.cmx and _opam/lib/ocaml/threads/threads.cmxa both define a module named Mutex
; maybe related: https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/1727, https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/597
; (implicit_transitive_deps false) ; does not help about the pulled-in Mutex from ocaml/threads
(wrapped_executables true) ; prefix compilation unit names; mentioned here: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/2218#issuecomment-572043299; doc says it's the default since dune 2.0, but it somehow still fixes the clash

; https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#generate-opam-files
; goblint.opam is generated on `dune build` (not normal make!) from this file and goblint.opam.template
; also remember to generate/adjust goblint.opam.locked!
(generate_opam_files true)

    (ocaml (>= 4.10))
    (dune (>= 2.9.1)) ; explicit lower bound needed for opam install (https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pull/4806), (lang dune 2.9.1) doesn't do this
    (goblint-cil (>= 1.8.2)) ; TODO no way to define as pin-depends? Used goblint.opam.template to add it for now. https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/3231. Alternatively, removing this line and adding cil as a git submodule and `(vendored_dirs cil)` as ./dune also works. This way, no more need to reinstall the pinned cil opam package on changes. However, then cil is cleaned and has to be rebuild together with goblint.
